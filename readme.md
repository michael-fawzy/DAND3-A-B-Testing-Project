## About

Analyzed A/B Test results using Python libraries and practical statistics to help an e-commerce website decide if they should implement a new webpage design:
-	Compared the probability of users converting from both pages.
-	Computed the p-value and used it to make conclusions based on the provided Type I error rate.
-	Compared the conversion rates of both pages using the calculated z-score and critical value.
-	Used Logistic Regression to help predict whether an individual will click to the website or not depending on the page viewed.
-	Made final conclusions based on statistical and practical reasoning regarding the null and alternative hypotheses.
